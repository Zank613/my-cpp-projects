# C++ Projects

Welcome to my collection of C++ projects! This repository is a tapestry of challenges and solutions, a testament to the learning journey I've embarked upon in the world of C++ programming.

## About the Repository

Each directory is a snapshot of my progression, with projects ranging from simple "Hello, World!" programs to more complex applications. Here's what you can expect to find:

- `beginner-challenges`: A set of exercises designed to build a solid foundation in C++ basics.
- `intermediate-endeavors`: As I grow more confident, this section will contain projects that tackle more intricate problems.
- `advanced-explorations`: The pinnacle of my C++ journey, featuring projects that implement sophisticated algorithms and demonstrate high-level programming concepts.

## Philosophy

The philosophy here is simple:

> "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." - Laozi

And every piece of code I write is a step forward on this journey. The goal isn't just to finish a project but to absorb the intricacies of the language, to challenge myself with each line of code, and to emerge as a more skilled programmer with every commit.

## What's Next - The Learning Path

While the journey so far has been enriching, there's much more to explore. Here's a sneak peek into the upcoming adventures:

- ~~Constants and Strings~~
- Operators
- Bit Manipulation
- Scope, Duration, and Linkage
- Control Flow and Error Handling
- Type Conversion and Function Overloading
- References and Pointers
- Enums and Structs
- Introduction to Classes
- More on Classes
- Dynamic arrays with `std::vector`
- Fixed-size arrays with `std::array` and C-style arrays
- Iterators and Algorithms
- Dynamic Allocation
- Functions
- Operator Overloading
- Move Semantics and Smart Pointers
- Object Relationships
- Inheritance
- Virtual Functions
- Templates and Generic Programming
- Exceptions and Exception Handling
- Input and Output (I/O) Streams

Stay tuned as each of these topics will gradually unfold into dedicated projects and challenges!
